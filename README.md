# Truss Software Engineering Interview

## Introduction and expectations

Hi there! Please choose *one* of the problems described below. Solve to the best of
your ability, using the tools you're most comfortable with. Assume
you're sending your submission in for code review from peers;
we'll be talking about your submission in your interview in that
context.

We expect this to take less than 4 hours of actual coding time. Please
submit a working but incomplete solution instead of spending more time
on it. We're also aware that getting after-hours coding time can be
challenging; we'd like a submission within a week and if you need more
time please let us know.

### How to submit your response

Please submit your solution by emailing a link to [hiring@truss.works](mailto:hiring@truss.works).  More details on what we are looking for are in the problem READMEs linked below.

## Choose one problem to work on

A README with specific instructions for each problem is linked below.

### The problem: [CSV normalization](CSV_README.md)

Please write a tool that reads a CSV formatted file on `stdin` and
emits a normalized CSV formatted file on `stdout`. For example, if
your program was named `normalizer` we would test your code on the
command line like this:

```sh
./normalizer < sample.csv > output.csv
```

### The problem: [Display data from an API for human consumption](BROWSER_README.md)

Please write a static webpage that loads data from a specified public API, and formats & displays that data in HTML. You may use libraries, frameworks and/or build tools as long as clear, simple instructions are provided for how to run them. Please ensure your solution can be easily viewed in the browser.

You may use additional files to organize your code. You may also use frameworks and build tools as long as clear, simple instructions are provided for how to run them. Please ensure your solution can be easily viewed in the browser.
